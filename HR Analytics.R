#Problem Statement
#A large company named XYZ, employs, at any given point of time, around 4000 employees. However, every year, around 15% of its employees
#leave the company and need to be replaced with the talent pool available in the job market. The management believes that this level of 
#attrition (employees leaving, either on their own or because they got fired) is bad for the company, because of the following reasons -

#The former employeesâ€™ projects get delayed, which makes it difficult to meet timelines, resulting in a reputation loss among consumers
#and partners
#A sizeable department has to be maintained, for the purposes of recruiting new talent
#More often than not, the new employees have to be trained for the job and/or given time to acclimatise themselves to the company
#Hence, the management has contracted an HR analytics firm to understand what factors they should focus on, in order to curb attrition.
#In other words, they want to know what changes they should make to their workplace, in order to get most of their employees to stay.
#Also, they want to know which of these variables is most important and needs to be addressed right away.

#Goal of the case study
#You are required to model the probability of attrition using a logistic regression. The results thus obtained will be used by the
#management to understand what changes they should make to their workplace, in order to get most of their employees to stay.

##Conclusions from the plots
#1. Employees who rarely travel tend to change company more.
#2. Employees in the Research & Development have higher tendency to change company.
#3. Employees with educational nackground of Life Sciences have higher attrition rate.
#4. Male employees have higher tendency of switching company.
#5. Employees of Job level 1 & 2 have equal to eachother and higher than other levels, of attrition rate.
#6. Married people show higher attrition rate.

#The factors that lead to the attrition of Employees are the following:
#Age
cor(masterfile_final$Attrition,masterfile_final$Age)     
#Age has a negative correlation with the attrition attribute, which means as people tend to get older they tend to
#stay in the company, i.e. younger people have higher chancer of attrition
